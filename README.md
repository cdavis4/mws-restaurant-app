#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

Convert static webpage to fully responsive, accessible mobile ready web application.

## Restaurants Reviews App: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Requirements

**Make the provided site fully responsive** All of the page elements should be usable and visible in any viewport, including desktop, tablet, and mobile displays. Images shouldn't overlap, and page elements should wrap when the viewport is too small to display them side by side.

**Make the site accessible** 
Using what you've learned about web accessibility, ensure that <kbd>alt</kbd> attributes are present and descriptive for images. Add screen-reader-only attributes when appropriate to add useful supplementary text. Use semantic markup where possible, and aria attributes when semantic markup is not feasible.

**Cache the static site for offline use.** Using Cache API and a ServiceWorker, cache the data for the website so that any page (including images) that has been visited is accessible offline.


## Restaurants Reviews App: Stage 2

In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use.
